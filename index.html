So we're going to be using this space as an excuse for learning how to use Git, GitHub, and web development; not that that subject I find interesting in the slightest, but that as an ancillary skill it seems rather useful. 

This whole thing is made possible due to the network effects of Git and Github. That's really something; it appears you can host a set of static pages here, which is more than sufficient for my purposes (for now). Eventually I'll probably have to rent a droplet and get serious, but for an interim solution this is likely the fastest path to content + web availability. 

In any event, on with the show.
