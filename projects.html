    <p>So we're going to be using this space as an excuse for learning how to use Git, GitHub, and web development; not that that subject I find interesting in the slightest, but that as an ancillary skill it seems rather useful. 

    <p>This whole thing is made possible due to the network effects of Git and Github. That's really something; it appears you can host a set of static pages here, which is more than sufficient for my purposes (for now). Eventually I'll probably have to rent a droplet and get serious, but for an interim solution this is likely the fastest path to content + web availability. 

    <p>In any event, on with the show.

        <h2>Understanding the FFT, Zonst, 2e</h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/trayres/qb64_zonst">Git Repo - Zonst QB64 Edition</a>
        <p> Here we're going to talk about a book I recently discovered which I think is absolutely amazing.

        <p>The author describes FFT's in a natural way and uses GWBASIC applications to immediately examine what's being discussed; which is great, but what are we to do?
        Who has a GWBASIC interpreter anymore? We could use any one of a number of modern BASIC interpreters, but I settled on QBASIC64. It's a wonderful piece of technology 
        that's free and looks open source.

        <p>So I'm going to do all of the suggested exercises, and see if I can expand upon them, as well as do them in both QB64 and Matlab/Octave.

        <p>The first program is "factorial.bas", which just computes the factorial in the traditional recursive way. Adorable. This wasn't in the book, but I thought for
             exposition it had to be added - plus more experience with BASIC/QB64. 
             <p>  <!-- language: lang-vb -->
                 
<pre><code>
REM Factorial computation, in the traditional recursive style
DIM a
a = Factorial!(5)
PRINT "Factorial(5):"; a
    
    
FUNCTION Factorial! (N!)
IF N! = 0 THEN Factorial! = 1 ELSE Factorial! = N! * Factorial!(N! - 1)
END FUNCTION</code></pre>

            <p>There's obviously some point to reading SICP, because if you see this you should recognize that it can be transformed (either by tail-call recursion or manually) into 
                a simple for loop:

<pre> <code>
REM Factorial computation in a for loop style
DIM a
a = Factorial!(5)
PRINT "Factorial(5):"; a


FUNCTION Factorial! (N!)
    REM Declare an accumulation variable
    DIM ACC
    ACC = 1
    FOR I = 0 TO N
        IF I = 0 THEN
            ACC = ACC
        ELSE
            ACC = I * ACC
        END IF
    NEXT I
    Factorial! = ACC
END FUNCTION     
</code></pre>
                
        <p>Page 1/2 mention the power series (Maclaurin/Taylor series), so let's go look that up. It's been a while and I'm rusty (hi Rusty, I'm Dad!)
            as well as the radius of convergence. As an aside, using an RPI with Mathematica on it to explore these kinds of things sounds like fun. 
            It looks like the section on that is buried all the way in Chapter 12 of Stewart's Calculus (6e). Well THAT doesn't sound great. Let's see what 
            if we can get some MathML for some of these equations; while you can do that from Mathematica, even that input seems clunky, so I'm trying MathCast and Lyx.
