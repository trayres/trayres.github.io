    <p>So we're going to be using this space as an excuse for learning how to use Git, GitHub, and web development; not that that subject I find interesting in the slightest, but that as an ancillary skill it seems rather useful. 

    <p>This whole thing is made possible due to the network effects of Git and Github. That's really something; it appears you can host a set of static pages here, which is more than sufficient for my purposes (for now). Eventually I'll probably have to rent a droplet and get serious, but for an interim solution this is likely the fastest path to content + web availability. 

    <p>In any event, on with the show.

        <h2>Understanding the FFT, Zonst, 2e</h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/trayres/qb64_zonst">Git Repo - Zonst QB64 Edition</a>
        <p> Here we're going to talk about a book I recently discovered which I think is absolutely amazing.

        <p>The author describes FFT's in a natural way and uses GWBASIC applications to immediately examine what's being discussed; which is great, but what are we to do?
        Who has a GWBASIC interpreter anymore? We could use any one of a number of modern BASIC interpreters, but I settled on QBASIC64. It's a wonderful piece of technology 
        that's free and looks open source.

        <p>So I'm going to do all of the suggested exercises, and see if I can expand upon them, as well as do them in both QB64 and Matlab/Octave.

        <p>The first program is "factorial.bas", which just computes the factorial in the traditional recursive way. Adorable.
