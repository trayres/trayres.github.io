    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>So we're going to be using this space as an excuse for learning how to use Git, GitHub, and web development; not that that subject I find interesting in the slightest, but that as an ancillary skill it seems rather useful. 

    <p>This whole thing is made possible due to the network effects of Git and Github. That's really something; it appears you can host a set of static pages here, which is more than sufficient for my purposes (for now). Eventually I'll probably have to rent a droplet and get serious, but for an interim solution this is likely the fastest path to content + web availability. 

    <p>In any event, on with the show.
