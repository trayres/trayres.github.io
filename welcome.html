    <h1>Various Projects</h1>
    <p>So we're going to be using this space as an excuse for learning 
how to use Git, GitHub, and web development; not that that subject I 
find interesting in the slightest, but that as an ancillary skill it 
seems rather useful. 

    </p><p>This whole thing is made possible due to the network effects 
of Git and Github. That's really something; it appears you can host a 
set of static pages here, which is more than sufficient for my purposes 
(for now). Eventually I'll probably have to rent a droplet and get 
serious, but for an interim solution this is likely the fastest path to 
content + web availability. 

    </p><p>In any event, on with the show.
